# Northumbria University Research Computing Community 

This is the website for the Northumbria University Research Computing Community. You can find information about [upcoming events](events/events.md), [sign-up to our newsletter](newsletter/signup.md), browse past newsletters, or access documentation for the [NU Supercomputer Oswald](oswald/what-is-oswald).

## What is the Research Computing Community?

Many researchers at Northumbria use computing for their research. This includes High-Performance Computing (HPC), Research Software Engineering (RSE), developers and users. Many of us also use similar tools, face similar problems, and teach similar topics - even if from different research domains. We hope that by sharing our experiences, our tips and tricks, our trials and tribulations, we will support and grow the research computing community at Northumbria.

## Contributing to the community

If you have any research computing-related news, ideas, projects, or events you want to share with the community, we'd love to hear from you. Please get in touch with ??? to have your submission considered for inclusion in our next newsletter. For example:

- Have you been using software or computing as part of your research and want to share outcomes or techniques?
- Have you been working on a software/computing project to assist in your or others' research that others may find useful?
- Perhaps you've come across some news or ideas about research software/computing that you want to share with the community?

If you're hosting a research computing-related event, we would also like to hear about it. Please get in touch with ??? and we can add your event to our list.

Also, if you find something incorrect, out of date or missing in this website, feel free to get in touch with ???. Or, if you have the time and skills to do so, you can even head over to [this website's GitHub repository](https://github.com/RSC-Northumbria/oswald-docs), make the edits yourself and create a Pull Request. We appreciate all contributions!
