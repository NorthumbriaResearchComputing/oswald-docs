## What is the Research Computing Community?

Many researchers at Northumbria use computing for their research. This includes High-Performance Computing (HPC), Research Software Engineering (RSE), developers and users. Many of us also use similar tools, face similar problems, and teach similar topics - even if from different research domains. We hope that by sharing our experiences, our tips and tricks, our trials and tribulations, we will support and grow the research computing community at Northumbria.
