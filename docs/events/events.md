# Research Computing Events at Northumbria

### Thursday 21st October - Northumbria Research Computing Launch event: 

https://rsc-northumbria.github.io/RSC-Northumbria-launch/

This is your chance to meet other researchers from across Northumbria University who use and develop research software. 

We will also have a keynote from Mike Croucher, who is a Customer Success Engineer at MathWorks. Mike works with researchers and educators on many different aspects of research computing. His interests center around research software engineering, high performance and cloud computing and various aspects of machine learning, mathematics and science. He has over 20 years of experience in the field.

Over lunch (which is provided) we will have discussion tables to explore various questions, including: where next for the Northumbria research computing community? do we want to run a regular newsletter? how can we best support research computing at Northumbria? how might we want to work with existing regional and national research computing networks?
